further updated the database schema to include an image for the service


### 27/05/24

Showed current layout and wireframe to client.

> Needs an about us section on the home page like in iteration two, but i like the single page layout of the first one with the big GeoSolutions front and centre.

Added a completed bookings table so the bookings can be flagged as completed

then changed it to an enum list so instead of having multiple tables for completed, in progress and unfinished. i can just have one table with an extra slot to contain all that data.
