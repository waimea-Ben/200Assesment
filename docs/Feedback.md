# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> Going well, Ben... But you need to push hard to get the UI designs done and refined ASAP


## System Requirements	

- [ -] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [x] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [x] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [x] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome

> The need - Describe the business, what they do, etc. Then describe the problem / need they have which you plan to solve.

> Implications are done well, however you should mention that **testing** is one of the key things you'll need to do for usability / functionality / end-user / etc.


## Database Structure	

- [x] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [x] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

> Good


## Front-End UI Designs

- [ -] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.

> You should be well into this by now!


## System Testing

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **E** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  


## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ -] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ -] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **M** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
