-------------------------------------------------

# System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

GeoSolutions nz td has a website current;y but the website does not allow them the manage the staff as they come and go, requiring the client to message the website manger every time she needs an update. her current website does not have a place for reviews and example which she would like to have.

### End-User Requirements

GeoSolutions clients are all 20s to 50s professional clientele. This means that any system must use clear and but advanced language. It should be accessible in terms of colours and fonts used. The level of IT expertise of the users could vary from high to very low. This means that the system must be very intuitive to use. the jobs are all earth related, so the system should be nicely designed, possibly with an earth theme.

### Proposed Solution

A website that allows a client to easily apply for a consultation, User should be able to:
- View a list of all the jobs available with a description of each
- make a booking with a dropdown menu for all the job types
- view staff credentials as well as contact details 
- Additionally, the system should:
    - Be very simple to use
    - Be accessible to all
    - Be well designed and a pleasure to use
- for admin they should be able to:
    - View a list of bookings (organised by name, or by date)
    - Add a new job type to the system
    - Add new staff to the system

# Relevant Implications

### USABILITY

Getting Things Done Quickly and Easily

this is relevant to my project because the website must be easy to use and efficient to use to make the user experience enjoyable

- Follow standard conventions 
- Make the behaviour of the outcome logical and familiar (e.g. page title leads to home page, etc.)
- Provide the end-user with a clear route forwards (and back out, if needed)
- Always make it obvious to the end-user what is happening (e.g. clear titles and loading pages, etc.)
- will need to use lots of testing to make sure it works in all circumstances

### FUNCTIONALITY

Everything Works, and Works Well

Websites must function as intended, so that the user can actually get done what they came there to do, and not take ages doing it.

 - Fully satisfy the original need / purpose (e.g. actually be able to make bookings, etc.)
 - Fully meet the user's requirements 
 - Make sure that it copes with all inputs (normal, boundary and abnormal)
 - will need to use lots of testing to make sure it works under all circumstances

### AESTHETICS

Great Designs with Style and Impact

Website must be pleasing to look at so the user can have an enjoyable user experience. as well as being able to easily see wht they're doing and find the elements with no issue. leading lines and frames help.

- Create an overall design that appeals to the end-users (e.g. layout has  curved edges and nice sizing, etc.)
- Create an overall design that is suitable for the outcome's purpose (e.g. icons and pictures that make sense like plants or dirt, etc.)
- Use colours that work effectively together to create a pleasing effect (e.g. have a colour pallet that follows colour theory, etc.)
- Use fonts that work well with the design and convey the business sense
- Position elements of the design in a way that is balanced (e.g. items centred and bordered, etc.)
- Group / separate elements to focus attention and/or link related items

### END USERS

Meets the User's Specific Needs

website must cater to the end users specific needs such as having all the job options explained so they can see which one they need, and having a place to see the certifications of each staff member so that they can know how qualified they all are.

- sculpt the site to suit the proper design conventions of a more mature end user (e.g. modern design, simplistic layout, etc.)
- Use language and other content appropriate to my end-users (e.g. advanced language, no slang, formal, etc.)
- page fully tailored to the stakeholders feedback structured how they want it.
- Ensure it works on a range of devices, especially those likely to be used by the clients (e.g. all images have an alt tag, high contrast all around site, etc.)
- will need to use lots of testing to make sure it suits all circumstances

### LEGALITY

Obey All Relevant New Zealand Laws

website must have exclusive rights to all photos as well as permission to distribute staff details and pictures.

- NZ privacy and data protection laws (e.g. [NZ Privacy Act 1993](https://privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/privacy-principles/))(e.g. make sure that users know that their data is being collected and put into a database for storage, etc.)
- NZ online bullying / harassment laws (e.g. [Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015](https://netsafe.org.nz/what-is-the-hdca/))(e.g. , etc.)
- cover the legal insurance of the GeoSolutions business as well as a terms and conditions page for legal cover
-------------------------------------------------


# User Experiences
 - ### Clear Navigation: 
Will need to ensure easy and intuitive navigation throughout the website. Users should be able to quickly find information about the services offered, the process involved, and how to contact GeoSolutions. Use clear and descriptive labels for navigation items such as "Services," "Process," "Contact Us," etc.

- ### Information Hierarchy:
 Must organize information in a logical hierarchy, prioritizing the most important information. For GeoSolutions, key information such as services offered, the importance of geotechnical reports, and the process involved in obtaining them should be prominently displayed.

- ### Consistent Branding:
 Must remain consistent in branding elements such as logo, colors, and typography across the website. Consistent branding helps in building trust and recognition. Ensure that GeoSolutions' branding is cohesive and reflects the professionalism and reliability of the company.

- ### Responsive Design:
 Must design the website to be responsive across various devices and screen sizes. Many users may access the website from mobile devices, so it's crucial to ensure a seamless experience regardless of the device being used.

- ### User-Friendly Forms:
 If the website includes forms for requesting quotes or contacting GeoSolutions, ensure they are user-friendly and easy to fill out. Minimize the number of required fields and provide clear instructions to avoid user frustration.

- ### Accessible Design:
 Will need to ensure that the website is accessible to users with disabilities. This includes using alt text for images and designing with color contrast in mind.
